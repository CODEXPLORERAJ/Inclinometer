Usage

1.Startup:
The device begins with a loading animation displaying sliding text ("Created By RoboVate") along with a dynamic loading bar.

2.Main Menu:
After the loading screen, the menu offers three options:
  -Normal Mode: Displays a rounded angle.
  -Precision Mode: Displays a detailed angle with one decimal place.
  -Calibrate: Initiates sensor calibration.

3.)Calibration:
If you select the Calibrate option, follow the on-screen instructions (e.g., "Lay me down face up") to calibrate the sensor. The calibration data is then stored in EEPROM.

4.)Angle Display:
In normal operation, the device continuously reads sensor data, converts the quaternion to Euler angles, and displays the appropriate angle on the OLED screen based on the selected mode.
